<h3>Dune</h3>

<p>Dune is a book I really want to read but will never. It's a sci-fi story by Frank Herbert written and published in 1965. It's supposed to be a revolutionary story that changed how many Americans think about science fiction. It's the first of like 6 books. The series pushed boundaries and touches on ideas that were never referenced prior, but are staples today. Things like AI, conscious robots, and computers. Crazy right? I don't know, I've never read it. I mean I listened to the audio book for like an hour or two. 
    Definitely stuff im in to, but will I finish it? No. It's like a million pages. Who has time to read an entire book. I mean, were in a crisis here people. Wake up!. Reading is for the weak. Like for real here guys. Don't you have some more important things to do. Our economies busted, people are dying, and schools are closed. Have you seen this latest generation? These kids need all the school they can get. And you wanna sit down and read a book. Selfish. "But I want to read it before the movie with Timoth√©e Chalamet is out!" Well that movie comes out in a couple months and that book looks like a pocket encyclopedia.  </p>
